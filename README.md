# reaction-speed-game
A simple Arduino-based reaction speed game that measures how fast a user can respond to an LED or buzzer signal.
 I just completed a fun hands-on electronics project using an Arduino Uno:
ðŸŽ® Reaction Speed Game â€” test how fast you can react!

ðŸ§  What it does:
This game lights up an LED or plays a buzzer sound after a random delay. The player must press the button as quickly as possible. The Arduino measures and displays your reaction time.

ðŸ”§ Tech Used:

Arduino Uno

LEDs, push buttons, buzzer

Embedded C

Basic circuit design

ðŸ’¡ What I learned:

Handling inputs and outputs in real time

Working with delays and timers in Arduino

Debugging circuits and code efficiently

ðŸ“· Iâ€™ve attached a few pictures/videos of the working prototype!

ðŸ“š This project helped me improve my embedded systems skills and gave me more confidence in hardware development.
